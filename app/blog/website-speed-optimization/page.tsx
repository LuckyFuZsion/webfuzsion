              Website speed is a critical factor for user experience and search engine rankings. Here's how to optimise
              your website for better performance.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Website Speed Matters</h2>
            <p>
              A slow website can lead to higher bounce rates, lower conversions, and poor search engine rankings.
              Studies show that users typically abandon sites that take more than 3 seconds to load. In fact, for every
              additional second of load time, conversion rates can drop by up to 7%.
            </p>

            <p>
              Google also considers page speed as a ranking factor, meaning faster websites are more likely to appear
              higher in search results. This is especially true since the introduction of Core Web Vitals as ranking
              signals.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Optimisation Techniques</h2>

            <h3>1. Optimise Images</h3>
            <p>
              Images often account for the majority of a webpage's size. Compress images and use modern formats like
              WebP to reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality. Consider implementing responsive images that load
              different sizes based on the user's device.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Enable Browser Caching</h3>
            <p>
              Set appropriate cache headers to allow browsers to store static resources locally. This means returning
              visitors won't need to download the same files again, resulting in faster page loads. Leverage tools like
              Cache-Control and Expires headers to control how long resources are cached.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML</h3>
            <p>
              Remove unnecessary characters, spaces, and comments from your code to reduce file sizes. This process,
              known as minification, can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred. Consider
              using tools like Terser for JavaScript, CSSNano for CSS, and HTMLMinifier for HTML.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>
            <p>
              Distribute your content across multiple servers worldwide to reduce latency for users. A CDN stores copies
              of your site on servers in various geographic locations, allowing users to download resources from the
              server closest to them. Popular CDN options include Cloudflare, Fastly, and Amazon CloudFront.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Implement Lazy Loading</h3>
            <p>
              Load images and videos only when they're about to enter the viewport to improve initial page load time.
              This technique, known as lazy loading, ensures that users only download the content they actually see,
              rather than loading everything at once. Modern browsers support native lazy loading with the
              loading="lazy" attribute.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Reduce Server Response Time</h3>
            <p>
              Choose a quality hosting provider and optimise your server configuration for faster response times. Server
              response time (Time to First Byte) is the time it takes for a browser to receive the first byte of
              information from your server. Improving database queries, implementing server-side caching, and using a
              faster hosting solution can all help reduce this time.
            </p>

            <h2>Measuring Website Speed</h2>
            <p>
              Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, or WebPageTest to measure your website's performance
              and identify specific areas for improvement. These tools provide detailed reports on various performance
              metrics and offer actionable recommendations for improvement.
            </p>

            <p>Key metrics to monitor include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance</li>
              <li>First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity</li>
              <li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability</li>
              <li>Time to First Byte (TTFB): measures server response time</li>
              <li>Total Blocking Time (TBT): measures main thread blocking</li>
            </ul>
